Concurrency control in database systems is a mechanism used to manage simultaneous operations without conflicting with each other, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state. The main goal is to ensure that the database maintains its integrity and consistency while allowing multiple transactions to occur concurrently. Here are the key concepts and techniques used in concurrency control:

### Key Concepts

1. **Transactions**: A sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a single unit of work. A transaction should be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID properties).

2. **ACID Properties**:
    - **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully; if not, the transaction is aborted.
    - **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
    - **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions are executed independently of one another.
    - **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure.

### Concurrency Control Techniques

#### 1. Locking

**Locking** is one of the most common techniques for concurrency control. It involves restricting access to data items to ensure that only one transaction can access the data at a time, preventing conflicts.

-   **Shared Locks (S)**: Allow multiple transactions to read a data item but not modify it.
-   **Exclusive Locks (X)**: Allow only one transaction to both read and modify a data item.
-   **Update Locks (U)**: Prevent deadlocks by allowing a transaction to lock a data item with the intention to update it later.

**Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**: Ensures serializability by dividing the locking process into two phases:

-   **Growing Phase**: A transaction may acquire locks but not release any.
-   **Shrinking Phase**: A transaction may release locks but not acquire any new ones.

**Strict Two-Phase Locking**: A stricter form where all locks are held until the transaction commits or aborts.

#### 2. Timestamp Ordering

**Timestamp ordering** ensures serializability by assigning a unique timestamp to each transaction. Transactions are executed in timestamp order, and conflicting operations are resolved based on these timestamps.

-   **Read Timestamp (RTS)**: The timestamp of the last transaction that read a data item.
-   **Write Timestamp (WTS)**: The timestamp of the last transaction that wrote to a data item.

If a transaction tries to read/write a data item, the system checks the timestamps to determine if it can proceed or must be aborted/rolled back.

#### 3. Optimistic Concurrency Control

**Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** assumes that conflicts are rare and allows transactions to execute without locking resources initially. At commit time, transactions are validated to ensure no conflicts occurred.

-   **Read Phase**: Transactions read and execute operations without acquiring locks.
-   **Validation Phase**: Before committing, transactions are validated to ensure no conflicts with other concurrent transactions.
-   **Write Phase**: If validation succeeds, changes are applied to the database; otherwise, the transaction is rolled back.

#### 4. Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)

**MVCC** uses multiple versions of data items to allow transactions to access different versions of the data concurrently.

-   **Read**: Each transaction sees a snapshot of the database at the time it started.
-   **Write**: Updates create new versions of data items rather than overwriting existing ones.
-   **Garbage Collection**: Old versions of data items are periodically cleaned up.

#### 5. Snapshot Isolation

**Snapshot Isolation** provides each transaction with a consistent snapshot of the database at the start of the transaction. This prevents conflicts by ensuring that transactions operate on consistent, immutable snapshots of the data.

-   **Read Operations**: Transactions read from their snapshot without being affected by concurrent updates.
-   **Write Operations**: Transactions write to the database if no other transaction has modified the data since the snapshot.

### Deadlock Management

Deadlocks occur when transactions wait indefinitely for resources held by each other. Deadlock management involves techniques to detect and resolve deadlocks.

-   **Deadlock Prevention**: Ensure that deadlocks never occur by imposing ordering on resource acquisition or by using timeouts.
-   **Deadlock Detection**: Periodically check for cycles in the wait-for graph (a graph of transactions and the resources they are waiting for).
-   **Deadlock Resolution**: Abort one or more transactions to break the cycle.

### Example Scenario

Consider two transactions, T1 and T2, both attempting to update the same account balance.

**Without Concurrency Control**:

-   T1 reads the balance.
-   T2 reads the balance.
-   T1 updates the balance.
-   T2 updates the balance.
-   Final balance may be incorrect due to lost updates.

**With Locking**:

-   T1 acquires an exclusive lock on the balance.
-   T2 waits until T1 releases the lock.
-   T1 updates and releases the lock.
-   T2 acquires the lock and updates the balance correctly.

### Conclusion

Concurrency control is crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency in a multi-user database environment. By employing techniques like locking, timestamp ordering, optimistic concurrency control, and multiversion concurrency control, database systems can effectively manage concurrent transactions while ensuring serializability and preventing anomalies such as lost updates, dirty reads, and phantom reads. Understanding and implementing these techniques is essential for designing robust and reliable database systems.
