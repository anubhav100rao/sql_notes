Isolation levels in database systems define the degree to which the operations of one transaction are isolated from those of other concurrent transactions. They ensure data consistency and reliability by controlling how changes made by one transaction become visible to other transactions. Let's delve into the types of isolation levels commonly supported by database management systems:

### Types of Isolation Levels

1. **Read Uncommitted**
2. **Read Committed**
3. **Repeatable Read**
4. **Serializable**

#### 1. Read Uncommitted

-   **Description**: This is the lowest isolation level. It allows transactions to read data that has been modified by other transactions but not yet committed. Transactions at this level may encounter dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
-   **Phenomena Allowed**:
    -   **Dirty Reads**: Reading uncommitted changes made by other transactions.
    -   **Non-repeatable Reads**: Reading different values for the same data within the same transaction.
    -   **Phantom Reads**: Getting different sets of rows for the same query within the same transaction due to concurrent inserts or deletes.
-   **Use Case**: Rarely used in production environments due to its potential for data inconsistency. It might be used in specific cases where data integrity is less critical and performance is paramount.

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
```

#### 2. Read Committed

-   **Description**: In this isolation level, a transaction can only read data that has been committed by other transactions. It prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
-   **Phenomena Allowed**:
    -   **Non-repeatable Reads**: Reading different values for the same data within the same transaction.
    -   **Phantom Reads**: Getting different sets of rows for the same query within the same transaction due to concurrent inserts or deletes.
-   **Use Case**: Commonly used in systems where balancing data consistency and concurrency is important. It provides better data integrity than Read Uncommitted while allowing higher concurrency.

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

#### 3. Repeatable Read

-   **Description**: This isolation level ensures that if a transaction reads a set of rows, it will get the same data set if it reads the same rows again within the same transaction. It prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads.
-   **Phenomena Allowed**:
    -   **Phantom Reads**: Getting different sets of rows for the same query within the same transaction due to concurrent inserts or deletes.
-   **Use Case**: Used in scenarios where consistency of data read within a transaction is crucial, and non-repeatable reads are not acceptable.

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
```

#### 4. Serializable

-   **Description**: Serializable is the strictest isolation level. It ensures that transactions are executed in such a way that they appear to be executed serially, one after the other. It prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads entirely.
-   **Phenomena Allowed**:
    -   None.
-   **Use Case**: Used in applications where data integrity is of utmost importance, and the cost of reduced concurrency is acceptable. It ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other in any way.

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

### Choosing the Right Isolation Level

The choice of isolation level depends on the specific requirements of the application:

-   **Performance vs. Consistency**: Lower isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed) offer higher performance and concurrency but at the cost of potential data inconsistencies. Higher isolation levels (Repeatable Read, Serializable) offer better data consistency but may reduce concurrency and performance.
-   **Application Requirements**: Consider the criticality of data integrity and the impact of concurrent transactions on each other.

### Default Isolation Levels

-   Most database systems default to Read Committed isolation level for transactions due to its balanced approach to consistency and concurrency.
-   It's important for developers and database administrators to understand the implications of each isolation level and choose accordingly based on their application's needs.

By understanding and effectively utilizing these isolation levels, database applications can maintain data integrity, ensure transactional consistency, and optimize performance based on specific use cases and requirements.
