Understanding the order of SQL execution is crucial for writing efficient and correct queries. Here’s a detailed explanation of the typical order in which SQL operations are executed, along with examples to illustrate each step.

### Order of SQL Execution

1. **FROM**
2. **JOIN**
3. **WHERE**
4. **GROUP BY**
5. **HAVING**
6. **SELECT**
7. **DISTINCT**
8. **ORDER BY**
9. **LIMIT**

### Explanation with Examples

#### Sample Data

Assume we have the following two tables:

**employees**
| id | name | salary | department_id | hire_date |
|-----|----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Alice | 60000 | 1 | 2020-01-15 |
| 2 | Bob | 70000 | 1 | 2019-02-20 |
| 3 | Charlie | 55000 | 2 | 2021-03-25 |
| 4 | David | 80000 | 2 | 2018-04-30 |
| 5 | Eve | 90000 | 3 | 2017-05-10 |

**departments**
| id | department_name |
|-----|------------------|
| 1 | HR |
| 2 | Engineering |
| 3 | Sales |

#### Example Query

```sql
SELECT d.department_name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE e.salary > 50000
GROUP BY d.department_name
HAVING AVG(e.salary) > 60000
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **FROM**

    - The query starts by identifying the primary table from which data will be selected. Here, it’s the `employees` table.

    ```sql
    FROM employees e
    ```

2. **JOIN**

    - The next step involves joining tables. The `departments` table is joined with the `employees` table based on the `department_id`.

    ```sql
    INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
    ```

3. **WHERE**

    - The `WHERE` clause filters rows before any grouping occurs. Here, it filters employees with a salary greater than 50,000.

    ```sql
    WHERE e.salary > 50000
    ```

4. **GROUP BY**

    - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the filtered rows based on the department name.

    ```sql
    GROUP BY d.department_name
    ```

5. **HAVING**

    - The `HAVING` clause filters groups based on a condition. In this case, it filters departments with an average salary greater than 60,000.

    ```sql
    HAVING AVG(e.salary) > 60000
    ```

6. **SELECT**

    - The `SELECT` clause specifies the columns to be returned, including the department name and the calculated average salary.

    ```sql
    SELECT d.department_name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
    ```

7. **DISTINCT** (if used)

    - If `DISTINCT` is specified, duplicate rows would be removed at this stage.

8. **ORDER BY**

    - The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set. Here, it orders the results by average salary in descending order.

    ```sql
    ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
    ```

9. **LIMIT**
    - Finally, the `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned. In this example, it limits the result to the top 2 rows.
    ```sql
    LIMIT 2;
    ```

### Complete Query Execution Flow

To summarize, the query execution follows these steps:

1. **FROM employees e**: Identify the `employees` table as the source.
2. **JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id**: Join `departments` table to `employees` table.
3. **WHERE e.salary > 50000**: Filter employees with salary greater than 50,000.
4. **GROUP BY d.department_name**: Group the remaining rows by department name.
5. **HAVING AVG(e.salary) > 60000**: Filter groups where the average salary is greater than 60,000.
6. **SELECT d.department_name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary**: Select department name and average salary.
7. **ORDER BY avg_salary DESC**: Sort the result by average salary in descending order.
8. **LIMIT 2**: Return only the top 2 rows.

By understanding this order of execution, you can write more efficient SQL queries and troubleshoot issues more effectively.
